## PheWAS

Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) analyze many phenotypes compared to a single genetic variant (or other attribute). This method was originally described using electronic medical record (EMR) data from EMR-linked in the Vanderbilt DNA biobank, BioVU, but can also be applied to other richly phenotyped sets.

## PheWAS in R Package

PheWAS can be ran in RStudio.
